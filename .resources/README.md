### EMOJIS SANCTUARY

This folder serves as a home for all animated emojis.   
The application uses the path and name passed on to `Emoji.razor` to retrieve the correct emojis from here.

###### Honestly, I was too lazy to download each emoji and then work out a dynamic system to load them up as and when needed. And I definitely did not want to include them all in the static wwwroot folder.
